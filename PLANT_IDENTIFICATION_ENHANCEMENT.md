### 4. **Enhanced Plant.id Integration**

The Plant.id API integration now requests comprehensive plant details including:

- Complete taxonomic classification
- Morphological characteristics
- Cultivation requirements
- Environmental tolerances
- Uses and applications
- Safety information
- Conservation status

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Existing variables
PLANT_API_KEY=your_plant_id_api_key
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

# New variables for enhanced features
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your_perplexity_api_key
```

### API Key Setup

1. **Gemini AI API**: Get your key from Google AI Studio
2. **Perplexity AI API**: Get your key from Perplexity.ai (format: `pplx-...`)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Plant Identification

1. Upload an image or take a photo
2. The system identifies the plant using Plant.id
3. Additional comprehensive data is fetched from multiple sources
4. All information is displayed in organized sections

### Information Categories Available

- **For Gardeners**: Cultivation requirements, maintenance guidelines, companion plants
- **For Researchers**: Complete taxonomy, morphological characteristics, conservation status
- **For Medical/Culinary Use**: Safety information, edible parts, traditional uses
- **For Conservationists**: Native range, threats, conservation measures
- **For Educators**: Interesting facts, cultural significance, related species

## Database Schema Updates

The Plant model has been completely restructured to accommodate:

- Nested objects for complex data (taxonomy, morphology, cultivation)
- Arrays for multiple values (synonyms, uses, threats)
- Proper indexing for search functionality
- Validation rules for data integrity

## Performance Optimizations

- Parallel API calls where possible
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Graceful fallbacks for failed requests
- Optimized database queries
- Responsive image loading

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. **Offline Mode**: Cache common plant data for offline access
2. **User Contributions**: Allow users to contribute additional information
3. **Advanced Search**: Filter by characteristics, uses, or region
4. **Plant Care Reminders**: Personalized care schedules
5. **Community Features**: Plant identification forums
6. **AR Integration**: Augmented reality plant identification
7. **Machine Learning**: Improve identification accuracy with user feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing API Keys**: Ensure all environment variables are set
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling for external APIs
3. **Data Inconsistencies**: The system handles missing data gracefully
4. **Large Response Times**: Consider implementing caching strategies

### Error Handling
